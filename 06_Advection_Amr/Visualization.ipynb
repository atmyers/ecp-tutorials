    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a drop of dye (we'll define $\\phi$ to be the concentration of dye) in a thin incompressible fluid that is spinning clock-wise then counter-clockwise with a prescribed motion. We consider the dye to be a passive tracer that is advected by the fluid velocity. The fluid is thin enough that we can model this as two-dimensional motion; here we have the option of solving in a 2D or 3D computational domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we want to solve for $$\\phi(x,y,t)$$ by evolving\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\bf{u^{spec}} \\phi) = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "in time ($t$), where the velocity $${\\bf{u^{spec}}} = (u,v)$$ is a divergence-free field computed by defining\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\psi(i,j) = \\sin^2(\\pi x) \\sin^2(\\pi y) \\cos (\\pi t / 2) / \\pi $$\n",
    "\n",
    "and defining\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u = -\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial y}, v = \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that because ${\\bf{u^{spec}}}$ is defined as the curl of a scalar field, it is analytically divergence-free\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we'll be using AMR to resolve the scalar field since the location of the dye is what we care most about.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The AMR Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "To update the solution in a patch at a given level, we compute fluxes (${\\bf u^{spec}} \\phi$)\n",
    "on each face, and difference the fluxes to create the update to phi.   The update routine\n",
    "in the code looks like\n",
    "\n",
    "```cplusplus\n",
    "  // Do a conservative update\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    phi_out(i,j,k) = phi_in(i,j,k) +\n",
    "                ( AMREX_D_TERM( (flxx(i,j,k) - flxx(i+1,j,k)) * dtdx[0],\n",
    "                              + (flxy(i,j,k) - flxy(i,j+1,k)) * dtdx[1],\n",
    "                              + (flxz(i,j,k) - flxz(i,j,k+1)) * dtdx[2] ) );\n",
    "  }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this routine we use the macro AMREX_D_TERM so that we can write dimension-independent code; \n",
    "in 3D this returns the flux differences in all three directions, but in 2D it does not include\n",
    "the z-fluxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing how to synchronize the solution at coarse/fine boundaries is essential in an AMR algorithm;\n",
    "here having the algorithm written in flux form allows us to either make the fluxes consistent between\n",
    "coarse and fine levels in a no-subcycling algorithm, or \"reflux\" after the update in a subcycling algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The subcycling algorithm can be written as follows\n",
